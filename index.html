                        Padma Seshadri Bala Bhavan, and earned a seat in the Indian Institute of Technology in Kharagpur, one of the
                        most prestigious engineering institutions in India.

                    <li>The success of Google’s toolbar gave Pichai the idea that Google should develop its own browser.
                        Pichai persevered and convinced the co-founders of Google, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, to launch Google’s own browser.
                        Pichai played a pivotal role in the ultimate launch of the browser, Google Chrome, in 2008.

                        Larry Page then made Pichai in-charge of Android as well.
                        His influence continued to increase and he was made the Product Chief in October 2014.</li>
                    <li>

                        and this took his holdings up to $650 million.
